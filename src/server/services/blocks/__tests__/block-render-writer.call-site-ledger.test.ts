/**
 * THE `blockRenders` WRITER SET, LEDGERED — and the ledger pins a RELATIONSHIP, not a
 * population.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT CLASS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴 TWO WRITERS INSERT INTO `blockRenders`: the `/api/track/block-render` beacon (what
 * the browser hosts use) and the `track.blockRender` tRPC procedure (kept for
 * bearer/API-key callers). Every rule that table needs therefore has to be applied
 * TWICE, and the repo already carries two mechanisms built for exactly that:
 * `blockRenderTrackerPayload` is a shared allowlist so an observability field cannot be
 * stripped on one side and forwarded on the other, and `secondary` suppresses the insert
 * symmetrically in both. The private-run exclusion is the third such rule, and a
 * one-sided version of it would let a bearer caller reintroduce the leak on the path
 * nobody watches.
 *
 * So this file asserts the three populations are THE SAME SET, and that the set is
 * exactly the two ledgered files:
 *
 *   1. who calls `.blockRender(` on a tracker — i.e. who writes the table at all;
 *   2. who builds the row through `blockRenderTrackerPayload` — the payload allowlist;
 *   3. who consults `isPrivateRunImpression` — the private-run gate.
 *
 * Equality in all three directions is what makes a NEW writer fail here: adding one
 * lands it in (1) and, unless it also does (2) and (3), the sets diverge. Deleting a
 * writer fails too — which matters because an exclusion that covers "both writers" stops
 * being a claim about anything the moment the writer set changes under it.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS A SOURCE-TEXT GUARD, AND WHY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH ALONE ─────────────
 * A STRUCTURAL check TYPE-CHECKS PAST A WRONG ARGUMENT: it cannot see a writer that
 * calls the gate with the wrong app id, with a body-derived viewer, or that ignores the
 * answer. That is the behavioural half's job — `src/tests/api/track/block-render.private-run.test.ts`
 * drives ONE fixture through both real writers and asserts they agree. Neither half is
 * sufficient: this one cannot see a wrong value, that one cannot see a third writer.
 *
 * ⚠️ `stripCommentsAndStrings` removes STRING LITERALS as well as comments, which is what
 * makes the scan immune to a name written in prose — and there IS prose to be immune to:
 * exactly one file names `isPrivateRunImpression` in a comment without calling it. A
 * control below pins that population BY NAME, so the immunity is measured rather than
 * assumed and a deleted paragraph is a red test rather than a silently-inert control.

 * that — a method on `Tracker`. Inferring "where is this defined" with a pattern that can
