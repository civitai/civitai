// App Blocks PER-GENERATION AUTHOR FEE — slice 2a, the ACCRUAL LEDGER ONLY.
//
// SLICE 1 (#4922) computed the fee and threw it away. This slice persists it.
// 🔴 IT DOES NOT PAY ANYONE — this module writes ledger rows and nothing else.
// The name of this file is the whole claim it makes: accrual.
//
// ── TWO HOPS, MIRRORING THE MODEL LICENSING FEE — THIS FILE IS HOP 1 ───────
//   1. AT SUBMIT the viewer is debited the fee, and one `accrued` row is written
//      naming the app owner it is owed to. That debit is the CALLER's job — this
//      module only records it.
//      🔴 THAT CALLER DOES NOT EXIST YET. Nothing in this repo calls
//      `accrueBlockAuthorFee` today. An earlier revision of this comment named
//      `chargeBlockAuthorFee` "in the router" as though it were there. It never
//      was — the name appeared nowhere but in that sentence.
//   2. DAILY the accrued rows are summed per (owner × buzz type) and minted to
//      the owner. That hop is `settleBlockAuthorFees` in the sibling module
//      `author-fee-settlement.service.ts`, which is slice 2b — a SEPARATE PR
//      from the ledger, because it has no consumer until hop 1 has a caller
//      supplying rows.
//
// The two-hop shape is exactly what `deliver-creator-compensation` does for the
// model licensing fee: the orchestrator charges the viewer at generation time,
// writes a per-resource fee row, and a daily job mints to the creator. Same two
// hops, same `externalTransactionId` dedup discipline, in a civitai-owned table
// because a licensing fee is keyed on a `modelVersionId` and an app fee has no
// model version.
//
// 🔴 THE PLATFORM IS A CONDUIT, NOT A PARTY. D1: the platform takes NO cut and
// funds NOTHING. So the author is credited EXACTLY what the viewer was debited —
// `feeBuzz` on the row is one number used on both sides. Any change that makes
// the credited total differ from the debited total is a change to that decision,
// not an implementation detail, and belongs in front of the operator.
//
// 🔴 NO FRACTIONAL ACCRUAL, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE REVERSAL. The design
// inherited "fractional accrual, daily sum-then-floor" from the licensing rail.
// It does not transfer. The licensing fee is fractional because it is priced
// per-IMAGE at 0.01 ⚡ and the viewer pays the CEILING of the sum, so the
// creator's share genuinely has sub-buzz resolution. This fee is
// `max(flatBuzz, pct × base)` FLOORED TO WHOLE BUZZ before the viewer is shown
// or charged it — D7 requires the viewer see the exact number before the run,
// and Buzz cannot express a fraction. There is no sub-buzz residue to carry.
// The daily batch therefore exists for LEDGER VOLUME (one mint per author per
// day instead of one per generation), not for rounding. (An earlier revision
// carried a defensive `Math.floor` here and a sentence explaining it; the floor
// was removed and the sentence outlived it by one commit. `fee_buzz` is an
// INTEGER column, so there is nothing to round.)
//
// ⚠️ THE CONSEQUENCE IS REAL AND SLICE 3 MUST SURFACE IT: an author who sets a 0
// flat leg and a low percentage earns NOTHING on cheap generations, forever —
// `floor(4 × 500/10000) = 0`, every time. That is the same shape as the $0.00
// spend bounty this whole arc replaced. The difference is that it is now the
// AUTHOR'S explicit choice and the platform default (flat 1 ⚡) avoids it.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// ── THE `D<n>` LABELS USED BELOW, STATED SO THEY RESOLVE HERE ──────────────
// They index an internal decision memo that is NOT in this repository, so a bare
// `D6` is authority with no referent for anyone reading this file. Each is
// therefore stated in full at least once:
//
//   D1  The fee is additive, author-set and viewer-paid. The platform takes NO
//       cut and funds NOTHING — so the author is credited exactly the amount the
//       viewer was debited.
//   D6  A viewer spending blue Buzz pays the fee in blue, and the author receives
//       blue (non-withdrawable). Currency is carried end to end, never coerced.
//   D7  The resolved fee must be shown to the viewer BEFORE the run. That is what
//       forces the fee to be a whole number the viewer can be quoted, which is
//       why the accrual amount is an integer rather than a fraction.
//
// ⚠️ `D8` and `D10` appear in this PR's description but implement nothing here —
// D8 is a process decision (build in three audited slices) and D10 records that
// the percent leg prices off `base` only, which slice 1 already did and which
// needed no code change. Do not go looking for them in this file.
