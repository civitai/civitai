/**
 * App Store Listings (W13) — P0 backfill.
 *
 * Creates one store-facing `AppListing` per existing APPROVED `AppBlock` so the
 * new listing entity is populated before any read path is cut over (P2). Fully
 * DARK: this only writes `app_listings` rows (read by nothing in the running
 * image) and NEVER touches the runtime `app_blocks` rows, the maturity gate, or
 * verify-runner.
 *
 * Two source shapes, one listing model (plan §5/§6):
 *   - on-site  — an `AppBlock` we host (external_url IS NULL) → kind='onsite',
 *                slug = AppBlock.blockId.
 *   - off-site — the #2821 external-link rows (external_url IS NOT NULL) →
 *                kind='offsite', `externalUrl` copied, NO connectClientId.
 *
 * NOTE: BOTH shapes set `appBlockId` — every backfilled row (on-site AND the
 * #2821 off-site rows) originates from an `app_blocks` row, and `appBlockId` is
 * the 1:1 idempotency key. So `appBlockId` is NOT a kind discriminator here:
 * downstream (P2/P3) readers MUST discriminate on the explicit `kind` column,
 * never on `appBlockId IS NULL`. (A future natively-created off-site listing —
 * no backing AppBlock — is what leaves `appBlockId` NULL.)
 *
 * INVARIANTS:
 *   - Idempotent on `appBlockId` (the 1:1 unique). A re-run creates no dupes and
 *     does NOT clobber a listing a creator may have edited (skip, don't update).
 *   - contentRating derives from `AppBlock.contentRating` — the listing is NOT a
 *     second source of truth for the .red/.com maturity/serving gate.
 *   - Assets (icon/cover/screenshots) are left NULL — the mandatory-asset gate +
 *     placeholder generation are P1. This backfill does NOT enforce it.
 *   - Owner = the `AppBlock`'s OauthClient owner (`app.userId`).
