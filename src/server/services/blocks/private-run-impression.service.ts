/**
 * Is this host mount a PRIVATE RUN, and therefore invisible to the app's owner in
 * analytics? Called by BOTH `blockRenders` writers to skip the insert.
 *
 * Mechanism, the shape that was rejected, the over-filtering bound and the acceptance
 * step are recorded ONCE, at the read site: `blocks/app-views.service.ts`. What follows
 * is only what a future edit to THIS file needs.
 *
 * 🔴 THE SIGNAL IS DERIVED, NEVER SUPPLIED. Both writers are public — a `privateRun`
 * field on the beacon would let ANY viewer suppress their own impressions, which is a
 * larger defect than the leak. The only body-derived input is `appBlockId`, and it cannot
 * suppress on its own: suppression also requires THIS SESSION to resolve to a private-run
 * audience for THAT app, from the database.
 *
 * 🔴 IT CALLS THE REAL `resolvePrivateRunAccess`, NOT A CHEAPER LOOKALIKE. A hand-rolled
 * "owner of a non-approved app" drifts the moment the predicate gains a refusal the copy
 * lacks — `not-deployed`, `owner-banned` and `no-iframe-src` each describe a mount that
 * is NOT a private run, and admitting them would delete real impressions.
 *
 * 🔴 ITS OWN MODULE BECAUSE THE LEDGER MUST SEE IT. `private-run-access.call-site-ledger`
 * excludes a symbol's DEFINING file from its caller set, so defining this inside
 * `private-run-access.service.ts` would have made the third consumer structurally
 * invisible and left the ledger reporting "exactly two callers" while being wrong.
 *
 * ── THE GATE ORDER IS THE COST DESIGN, NOT A DETAIL ──────────────────────────
 * This sits on a beacon that fires once per host mount and exists to avoid per-call
 * middleware, while the predicate costs 4–9 single-row queries (one on the WRITE
 * PRIMARY). So the gates run cheapest-first and each must SHORT-CIRCUIT the next; the
 * suite asserts that by call counts, so a reordering is a red test rather than a latency
 * mystery. Two hazards the code cannot state itself:
 *
 *   · Gate 2 uses `isConfirmedNonApprovedAppBlockId`, NEVER `!isKnownAppBlockId` — the
 *     approved-id cache fails safe to an EMPTY set, so the negation would read a database
 *     outage as "every app is non-approved" and send every signed-in beacon into the
 *     expensive path during exactly that incident. Correctness at gate 2 is not required
 *     in either direction; the predicate re-checks status authoritatively.
 *   · That cache has a 5-MINUTE TTL, so a JUST-APPROVED app falls through gate 2 for up
 *     to that long — precisely its hottest window.
 *
 * 🔴 WHICH BRANCH RUNS IS CHOSEN BY THE CALLER, NOT BY A MOUNT. `appBlockId` comes out of
 * the request body, so "an app confirmed not approved" is any string a signed-in caller
 * cares to send, and the common beacon path did ZERO Postgres queries before this. That
 * is a COST property, not an authorization one — but it is why the flag's own precondition
 * block carries "this route has no rate limit" as a gate on widening.
 *
 * 🔴 AN ABSENT FLAG KEY THROWS: it bypasses the eval cache (only successful evaluations
 * are cached) and logs on every reaching call. The key must EXIST, base-off, before this
 * path takes traffic. Read its live state from Flipt, never from a comment.
 *
 * KNOWN SIDE-EFFECT: the dev tunnel also mounts a non-approved app for its OWNER, so with
 * the flag on their own dev-tunnel mounts stop appearing in their own impressions —
 * self-affecting, on an app with no public audience. Discriminating the two would need a
 * trusted per-mount signal, which is exactly what does not exist.
 *
 * NOT suppressed: the prom render counter and launch histograms. Internal-only, app id
 * clamped to 'other'. Hiding the owner-visible rail is the decision; blinding ourselves
 * is not — and it is why the fix is here rather than a client-side skip, which the tRPC
 * writer would bypass entirely.

/**
 * The fail-open health signal. Never throws, never rejects, never awaited.
 *
 * 🔴 ITS OWN try/catch BECAUSE A THROW INSIDE A `catch` BLOCK IS NOT CAUGHT BY THAT
 * BLOCK. Inlined, a logging client that failed SYNCHRONOUSLY would escape the gate — and
 * `block-render.ts` awaits it with no try/catch of its own, so that is a 500 on a public
 * beacon AND a lost impression. ⚠️ NOT REACHABLE TODAY: `logToAxiom` is an `async
 * function`, which converts a sync throw into a rejection, so this half is an invariant
 * guard against a future non-async logger rather than a fix for a live escape. Cheap
 * enough to keep; do not cite it as a bug that was found.
 *
 * 🔴 THE `.catch` IS A DIFFERENT MECHANISM, NOT THE ASYNC HALF OF THE SAME ONE. Nobody
 * awaits this promise, so a rejection would not reach the gate at all — it would be an
 * UNHANDLED REJECTION. `packages/civitai-axiom` records what that costs: its own client
 * is called without awaiting by the background jobs pods, and an unhandled rejection
 * there exited the process — all three pods died at once. ⚠️ THAT INCIDENT PREDATES THE
 * CONTAINMENT THAT SHIPPED IN THAT CLIENT, so today's `logToAxiom` cannot realistically
 * reject either: this half is an invariant guard too, exactly like the `try` above. Do
 * not cite it as a live hazard — that package's own docblock retracts the adjacent
 * theory about its own race, and labels the test that appears to cover it an invariant
 * guard for the same reason.
 *
 * 🔴 BUT NOT SILENT. A gate that fails open without a trace means the leak is reopened
 * and nothing says so — the reassuring-zero shape. Bounded: reachable only on the rare
 * path (a signed-in viewer, an app confirmed NOT approved, the flag on), so it cannot
 * become a per-impression flood.
 *
 * 🔴 THE ERROR CLASS, NEVER THE MESSAGE. A `PrismaClientValidationError` renders the
 * failing invocation INCLUDING ITS ARGUMENTS, and the invocation inside the try is
 * `user.findUnique({ where: { id: <viewer.id> } })` — so a message would carry the
 * viewer's id onto a public write path's log. This is a health signal, not a second audit
 * trail; the identifiers live in the mint's audit line.
