// never sees the catalog — only the single picked resource comes back via
// RESOURCE_PICKER_RESULT. This generalizes the model-slot OPEN_CHECKPOINT_PICKER
// (IframeHost) from Checkpoint-only to a typed allowlist.
//
// Type allowlist: Checkpoint + the generator's LoRA FAMILY (LORA, LoCon, DoRA).
// Matches the page-LoRA body contract — a LoRA-family model.type goes to
// additionalResources, Checkpoint to modelVersionId. Any other requested type is
// REJECTED (the request is dropped, the modal never opens) so a block can't open
// an embeddings/VAE/wildcards picker on a page.
//
// Why LoCon + DoRA belong here and nothing else does — this CLOSES a gap rather
// than opening one. The SPEND-time gate `PAGE_LORA_MODEL_TYPES`
// (server/services/blocks/workflow.service, enforced by `resolvePageLoraGates`)
// has always been {LORA, LoCon, DoRA} — the same set the platform's
// compatibility model groups as the LoRA family (basemodel.constants'
// `fullAddonTypes` / `sdxlCrossAddonTypes` / `sdxlSiblingAddonTypes` each list
// all three side by side). So LoCon and DoRA were already spend-legal while
// being unpickable: an author could only reach them by hard-coding a version id.
// Widening the picker to exactly that set adds no type the submit path would
// then reject, and moves NO gate — the spend-time set is untouched by this
// change. Adding a type OUTSIDE the LoRA family (VAE, TextualInversion,
// Wildcards, Upscaler, Hypernetwork, …) would be the opposite: a picker offering

//
//   { scope: 'app',  path: 'detail/500' }  → APP-SCOPED, and the DEFAULT.
//        Resolved under the block's own route (`<base>/<slug>/detail/500`),
//        shallow, so the page stays mounted and the sub-path change reflects back
//        into the block through ROUTE_CHANGED. This is the pre-#5209 behaviour.
//   { scope: 'site', path: 'models/500' }  → SITE-ABSOLUTE. The host leaves the
//        app and lands on the site page, non-shallow. Unrestricted across page
//        routes — there is deliberately NO destination allowlist — except the one
//        narrow `/api/*` refusal, and only on a surface that HOLDS the capability
//        (`BLOCK_HOST_SITE_NAVIGATION`).
//
// 🔴 `scope` DEFAULTS TO `'app'`, AND THAT DEFAULT IS THE POINT, not a
// convenience. Every block deployed today sends no `scope` at all, so every one
// of them keeps exactly the behaviour it had before this change — for `'/x'` and
// for `'x'` alike. A host that cannot be rolled out without re-releasing the
// fleet is not a host change, it is a fleet migration.
//
// 🔴 A LEADING SLASH CARRIES NO MEANING. `scope` selects the space and `path` is
// a path WITHIN that space, so leading slashes are NORMALISED AWAY:
// `{scope:'app', path:'/settings'}` and `{scope:'app', path:'settings'}` are one
// request, as are `{scope:'site', path:'/models/500'}` and
// `{scope:'site', path:'models/500'}`. DO NOT reintroduce punctuation semantics
// here — see the retraction below for what it cost the first time.
//
// ⚠️ RETRACTED DESIGN, recorded so it is not re-derived: an earlier revision of
// this change keyed site-vs-app on the LEADING SLASH itself — `/models/500` was
// site, `models/500` was app. That is wrong for a reason specific to this
// platform, not merely inelegant. A page block owns a whole multi-page sub-path
// space (`/apps/run/[slug]/[[...path]].tsx`, the `subPath` in its init payload,
// the ROUTE_CHANGED forwarding above), so `navigate('/settings')` — the standard
// SPA idiom for an app's OWN absolute route — is a request every block author
// would write meaning "my settings page". Under the slash rule it silently left
// the app. And because BOTH spellings meant app-scoped before this change, that
// was a silent meaning change for every block ever written, delivered by a host
// deploy, with no version gate and no way for the block to notice: NAVIGATE is
// fire-and-forget, with no requestId and no NACK. Carrying intent in punctuation
// is exactly the prose/heuristic shape a deterministic field replaces.
//
// CONSEQUENCE, stated because it is the cost of the default and not a defect:
// the one real fleet caller of site-absolute navigation today
// (`civitai-app-custom-generators`, whose `onOpenInGenerator` calls
// `navigate('/generate')`) sends no `scope`, so it is app-scoped here and still
// does not reach the site generator. It did not reach it before this change
// either — so this is not a regression — but it does mean the host change ALONE
// no longer fixes that consumer. The app must opt in with `scope: 'site'`.
//
// WHY SITE SCOPE IS ALLOWED AT ALL, and why the width is an operator decision:
//   - The DEV host already behaves this way. `@civitai/blocks-react`'s `liveHost`
//     resolves the path against the backend origin and assigns it, with a comment
//     saying "so an in-app path (`/models/123`) opens on the real site".
//   - The published SDK JSDoc and the developer docs both promise it, and both use
//     `/models/12345` as the worked example.
//   So production was the odd one out among host, dev host and documentation.
//   This DOES widen what a block can do, deliberately. `ALLOWED_SANDBOX_TOKENS`
//   carries no `allow-top-navigation*`, so before this change a block could not
//   move the TOP frame at all — an `<a href>` it renders navigates its OWN frame,
//   at an opaque origin. Top-frame same-site navigation is a NEW capability,
//   granted on purpose and with the blast radius stated.
//   ⚠️ RETRACTED DRAFT, recorded so it is not re-derived: this comment used to
//   read "It does not widen what a block can persuade a viewer to visit." That
//   was false, and false in the direction that made the change look cheaper than
//   it is. The three-way agreement above establishes site-absolute REACHABILITY;
//   it does not establish that UNRESTRICTED is the right width — an allowlist
//   satisfies host, dev host and docs equally. The width is an operator decision
//   (see the PR), not something this argument derives.
//
// WHAT IS STILL REFUSED (fail-closed; a refusal returns `null` and the caller
// drops the message — NAVIGATE is fire-and-forget with no requestId, so a drop
// can never hang the block):
//   - any scheme (`https:`, `javascript:`, `data:`, …) and protocol-relative
//     `//host` — a block cannot push the host at another origin;
//   - backslashes, which several URL parsers fold to `/`;
//   - C0 controls, DEL and C1, which parsers strip wherever they appear (a
//     stripped byte changes which string the guard judged vs which one the browser
//     resolves). ⚠️ NOT a space, in ANY position — this line read "control
//     characters and whitespace" while a leading/trailing space was also refused,
//     and that rule is gone (see the retraction in `navigatePathIsHostile`);
//   - PERCENT-ENCODED path separators (`%2f`, `%5c`, either case) anywhere in the
//     block's own string — the only encodings that can change how many segments a
//     path has if anything downstream decodes once (see `navigatePathIsHostile`);
//   - any path whose RESOLVED form has a different SEGMENT STRUCTURE from the one
//     the block sent — which is what covers every traversal spelling, `.` and `..`
//     and `%2e` alike, without naming one (see the RESOLVED-FORM note below); plus
//     empty path segments (the `a//b` shape), which resolution does NOT collapse;
//   - an app-scoped path that leaves the block's own route — containment is
//     asserted on the resolved path;
//   - site scope on a surface that does not hold the capability;
//   - 🔴 `/api/*`, SITE SCOPE ONLY. A DELIBERATE NARROW EXCLUSION, and explicitly
//     NOT a destination allowlist. `/api/*` is not a page route, so a
//     `router.push` at it does not render anything — Next falls back to a HARD
//     navigation. The worked case is `/api/auth/logout`, and it is REAL: that
//     handler takes a bare GET with no `req.method` gate, no 405 and no CSRF
//     token, so it clears the session, device and legacy cookies and revokes the
//     token at the hub — on a block's say-so. `window.open` reaches it too, so
//     the refusal is load-bearing in BOTH targets.
//     ⚠️ An earlier draft named `/api/auth/signout`, which does NOT exist in this
//     repo: that is a next-auth name and auth here is `@civitai/auth`, whose
//     route is `logout.ts`. Do not "fix" this guard by checking the old example
//     and finding nothing there — the hole it covers is real.
//     Excluding `/api/*` costs the feature nothing (no page destination lives
//     there) and is the only content-based refusal here. An APP-scoped `api/...`
//     is untouched: it resolves under the block's own route and reaches no site
//     handler.

  // What the rule claimed: that it was not subsumed by the structural rule below,
  // because `' /models/1'` "resolves to `/models/1` with the segment count
  // PRESERVED, so the count comparison cannot see the trimmed byte". The
  // CONCLUSION was right — the structural rule genuinely cannot see it — but the
  // MECHANISM was false for the leading position, and that is the half the worked
  // example named. The candidate is REBUILT as `/${path}` before resolution, so a
  // leading space is never at a string END for WHATWG to trim: measured,
  // `new URL('/ x', <sentinel>).pathname` is `/%20x`, and `' /models/1'` resolves
  // to `/%20/models/1`, NOT to `/models/1`. It is percent-encoded exactly like the
  // INTERIOR space this change deliberately re-admitted. So the leading half had
  // no mechanism at all: nothing is trimmed, therefore nothing is hidden from any
  // guard.
  //
  // The TRAILING half's mechanism IS real — `new URL('/x ', <sentinel>).pathname`
  // is `/x`, at an unchanged count of 2 → 2 — and it still closed nothing, because
  // every decision downstream reads the RESOLVED path, which is this function's
  // whole design: the `/api` first-segment check, app containment, and the
  // returned `href` itself. Measured with the rule removed,
  // `{ scope: 'site', path: 'api/auth/logout ' }` is STILL refused, by the `/api`
  // check reading the resolved first segment.
  //
  // So it was fail-closed POSTURE, not a hazard closure, and it cost
  // `navigate(' x')` and `navigate('x ')`, both of which WORKED at the merge base.
  // That is the same class the structural rule was relaxed to re-admit, and the
  // same class the interior-space refusal above was removed for: an app sub-path
  // in the block author's own namespace, dropped silently, undetectable by the
  // block. Dropped for consistency with that decision rather than kept as a third
  // spelling of it.
  //
  // MEASURED BEFORE DROPPING, over a 26-shape space corpus in BOTH scopes:
  // 0 containment escapes, 0 `/api` leaks, 0 off-origin (3/26 accepted with the
  // rule; 13/26 site and 15/26 app without it). Every href the wider set accepts
  // is a re-resolution FIXPOINT — 21 of 21, against a positive control (`/a/../b`)
  // that is not — so no consumer can re-derive a different path from one. And
  // whitespace-ONLY paths stay refused without this rule: `' '` and `'/ '` resolve
  // to `/`, which the structural rule sees as 2 → 1.
  //
  // 🔴 THE INTERIOR CASE USED TO BE REFUSED HERE TOO, by a class that ran to
  // `U+0020` INCLUSIVE, and that was a SECOND refusal channel for exactly the class
  // the structural rule below was relaxed to admit. Fixing only the structural rule
  // would have left `navigate('a b')` — which WORKED at the merge base, no
  // resolver having existed then — silently dropped, with the fix looking
  // applied and a green suite. Both channels had to move; this paragraph is why
  // U+0020 is excluded from the control-character class on the line above.

  // Protocol-relative (`//host`, and `/\host` which Chrome folds to it). Note

 * hazard existed in a different spelling: WHATWG URL counts `%2e` as a dot

 * and a first segment of `%2e%2e` rather than `api`, and passed — while BOTH

 *
 * `target: 'new_tab'` reaches the handler through `window.open` with no Next
 * involved; `target: 'current'` reaches it because Next's `parseRelativeUrl` is
 * `new URL`-based and hands the router the NORMALISED pathname, which then misses
 * the route manifest and hard-navigates. Neither needs a user gesture. The same
 * root cause broke app-scope containment — measured,
 * `/apps/run/<slug>/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/x` resolved to `/x`.
 *
 * 🔴 THE TEST IS STRUCTURAL, AND IT USED TO BE BYTE-EQUALITY. THAT WAS A
 * REGRESSION AGAINST `origin/main` AND IS THE SECOND THING THIS FUNCTION FIXES.
 * The first fix asked "is the resolved pathname ALREADY the string handed in?" —
 * a normalisation FIXPOINT. That closed the hole, but it refuses everything
 * resolution rewrites, which is every non-ASCII codepoint and every member of the
 * URL path percent-encode set (space, `"`, `<`, `>`, `^`, `` ` ``, `{`, `}`). Two
 * reachable costs, one of them a genuine regression:
 *   - `/tag/<tagname>` is a live route (`src/pages/tag/[tagname].tsx`) and this
 *     codebase already percent-encodes tag names when it builds that URL itself
 *     — 5 sites across 3 files, derived rather than quoted:
 *     `find src -type f \( -name '*.ts' -o -name '*.tsx' \) -print0 | xargs -0
 *     grep -n 'tag/${encodeURIComponent'`. (⚠ an earlier draft said "three
 *     places"; that was an undercount from a narrower search.) So the codebase
 *     already concedes tag names are not ASCII-safe, and a block could not link
 *     one.
 *   - 🔴 APP-SCOPED SUB-PATHS. At the merge base there was no resolver at all:
 *     leading slashes were stripped and only `//`, a literal `..` segment and a
 *     re-leading `/` were refused. So `navigate('José')`, `navigate('café')` and
 *     `navigate('a b')` each pushed `/apps/run/<slug>/<raw>` and WORKED. The
 *     fixpoint rule dropped all three silently. App sub-paths are entirely the
 *     block author's own namespace, so that is the member most likely to exist in
 *     the wild, and a block cannot detect the drop.
 *
 * So the rule is now: the resolved path must have the SAME SEGMENT STRUCTURE as
 * the candidate. Every traversal shape changes the segment count (`/%2e%2e/api/x`
 * is 3 → 2); pure percent-encoding normalisation preserves it (`/tag/José` is
 * 3 → 3, rewritten but not restructured). That keeps the guard structural — no
 * dot spelling is named anywhere in it — while allowing the international and
 * space-bearing paths the byte comparison refused. See `navigateSegmentCount` for
 * the trailing-dot-segment correction the naive count needs, and the corpus it
 * was measured over.
 *
 * Encoding shapes considered and decided, so none of this is re-derived:
 *   - `%2e` / `%2E`, and the mixed `.%2e` / `%2e.` forms: closed by the segment
 *     count. Case never enters into it, because nothing pattern-matches a
 *     spelling — the counts of two strings are compared.
 *   - `%2f` / `%5c` (encoded separators): refused upstream in
 *     `navigatePathIsHostile`, with the reasoning there.
 *   - `%252e` (double-encoded): ALLOWED, and this is a decision, not an oversight.
 *     Reaching a dot segment from it needs TWO decodes; `new URL` does zero, so
 *     `/%252e%252e/api/x` keeps 5 segments and its first segment is the literal
 *     string `%252e%252e`. A single downstream decode yields `%2e%2e`, still a
 *     literal segment — dot-segment resolution happens in the URL parser BEFORE
 *     the request is sent, not after a server decodes it, so there is no second
 *     resolution pass for the decoded form to be fed into. Refusing `%25`
 *     outright was considered and rejected: `/models/500/50%25-off-lora` is a
 *     legitimate civitai slug route, so that would be a real false refusal.
 *   - a trailing slash: tolerated exactly as before (one, and only at the end).
 *     `/api/` still refuses because the segment check runs on the stripped path;
 *     `/apps/run/<slug>/` still satisfies containment because it strips to the
 *     base itself. The strip happens after the structural check, and the stripped
 *     result is itself structurally stable, which is pinned by an idempotency test.
 *   - a surviving `%` that changes SEGMENTATION: impossible once `%2f`/`%5c` are
 *     refused, because those are the only single decodes that produce a
 *     separator. A surviving `%` can still change a segment's VALUE (`%61pi`
 *     decodes to `api`), which is why the `/api` check below decodes before
 *     comparing.
 *   - a character resolution REWRITES rather than preserves (`/a<b` becomes
 *     `/a%3Cb`, `/tag/José` becomes `/tag/Jos%C3%A9`): now ALLOWED, and the
 *     returned href is the RESOLVED form, so what was judged is what is pushed.
 *     That is the regression fix above.

// that a transient launch failure required the user to notice and press a
// button, and the button was easy to miss ("there might have been a retry
// button but I didn't notice — I did a full page reload"). So the host now
// re-attempts the load ITSELF a bounded number of times, and only after that
// budget is spent does it settle on a definitive terminal state whose manual
// Retry is made prominent.
//
// 🔴 THE TERMINAL STATE IS NEVER DELAYED OR MASKED. The host renders the real
// terminal `BlockFallback` the instant a terminal status is reached; the pending
// auto-retry is surfaced as ADDITIONAL copy inside that same fallback. There is
// no "keep spinning while we quietly retry" state — that would recreate the
// silent-blank failure class this codebase has fought repeatedly.
//
// 🔴 BOUNDED, ALWAYS. Two independent caps:
//   - MAX_AUTO_RETRIES bounds the total automatic attempts per host mount.
//   - MAX_AUTO_REMINTS bounds how many of those may spend a token RE-MINT.
//     `/api/v1/block-tokens` is rate-limited (60/min per user+instance), and an
//     unbounded auth-failure loop is exactly the shape that would burn it.
// The budgets are per MOUNT and are NOT refilled by a manual Retry — once spent,
// every subsequent failure goes straight to the definitive terminal state.

/**
 * Maximum AUTOMATIC load re-attempts per host mount (the initial load excluded).
 *
 * 🔴 ROLLBACK: setting this to 0 cleanly disables auto-retry entirely — the
 * decision returns `none` for every status, so the terminal fallback renders
 * immediately with the prominent manual Retry and `autoRetriesSpent` stays 0 (no
 * false "we already retried" copy). It is the one-line kill switch; there is no

 * The most BLOCK_INIT posts one successful launch can make **via the bounded

 * deliberately uncapped (`handleRetry` spends no automatic budget), and
 * `performRetry` resets neither the launch marks nor `blockRenderEmittedRef`.
 * So a user who clicks Retry repeatedly *inside the auto-retry backoff window*
 * keeps `autoRetryBudget.attempts` at 0, emits no beacon yet, and accumulates

 *
 * The consequence is bounded and lands in the safe direction: past
 * `MAX_LAUNCH_INIT_POSTS` the count is DROPPED, never clamped, so no wrong value
 * is ever published. What it does cost is a launch counted in
 * `launch_total_seconds` but absent from `launch_init_posts` — which is exactly
 * why the histogram's help text insists on its OWN `_count` as the denominator.
 *
 * 🔴 THE POST-COUNT SIBLING OF `worstReachableLaunchMs`, and it exists for the

 * The discard would be signal-correlated and would make the metric answer "no
 * quantization here" by construction.
 *
 * 🔴 THE COUNT IS PER LAUNCH, NOT PER CONTROLLER. The auto-retry path builds a
 * fresh `IframeInitController` per attempt but does NOT reset the launch marks,
 * so the posts accumulate across every attempt of one launch. The bound is
 * therefore `attempts x per-attempt-max`, plus one `BLOCK_HELLO` push per

// ── MID-SESSION CREDENTIAL-LOSS render beacon ────────────────────────────────
//
// 🔴 THE GAP THIS CLOSES (measured on production 2026-07-31): a real revocation
// teardown was driven end-to-end against a live app and the platform recorded
// ZERO error beacons. Its only record of the incident was the earlier,
// successful `ok` impression — so from the metric's point of view the app was
// perfectly healthy while it was, in fact, dead in every viewer's tab.
//
// WHY IT WAS ZERO. The host's ONE-beacon-per-mount rule is enforced by a single
// emit-once ref shared by the `ok` impression and the launch-FAILURE beacon.
// A host that reached `ready` has already spent that ref on `ok`, so when the
// `tokenTerminal` effect later tears it down to `error`, the failure beacon is
// inert BY CONSTRUCTION — not by accident, and not fixable by relaxing the ref
// (that would retroactively double-count impressions and corrupt the denominator
// the alert is built on, which is "page loads").
//
// THE FIX IS A SECOND, INDEPENDENT AT-MOST-ONCE CHANNEL. The mid-session beacon
// gets its OWN ref, so:
//   - the `ok` impression already sent is untouched (analytics unchanged);
//   - the teardown is reported exactly once per mount;
//   - it is tagged `token_lost_midsession`, which no launch failure can emit,
//     so the two are trivially separable in PromQL.
// A mount that loses its credential mid-session therefore emits TWO beacons —
// `ok` then `error{error_class="token_lost_midsession"}` — and that is the
// intended, documented shape: they describe two DIFFERENT events (the load
// succeeded; the session was later revoked), not one event counted twice.
