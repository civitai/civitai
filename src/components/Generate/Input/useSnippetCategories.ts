/**
 * Resolve the popover-ready category list for the snippets feature, reading
 * `wildcardSetIds` directly from the active `snippets` node in graph context.
 * Implements the form-mount sequence the v1 doc spec'd:
 *
 *   1. Fetch the caller's own User-kind set (always implicitly loaded).
 *   2. Fetch the union of (own-set-id ∪ ids-from-graph) via `getMany`.
 *   3. Flatten the (set, category) pairs into one item per (category, set)
 *      row — the popover groups by category internally.
 *
 * Sorted alphabetically by name, then by source name as a stable
 * tiebreaker. Ids the caller isn't authorized for are silently dropped
 * server-side (matches the inline `kind`/`ownerUserId` predicate in the
 * read service).
 *
 * Returns enough context for an Active Wildcards strip alongside the
 * categories list — `loadedSets` carries set-level metadata (name, kind,
 * audit/invalidated state, valueCount per category) so the strip can
 * render without re-querying.
 *
 * Must be called inside a `DataGraphProvider`. When the active subgraph
 * has no `snippets` node, the hook treats `wildcardSetIds` as empty —
 * still safe to call unconditionally (no errors, just empty results).
