/**
 * The reaction-bar entry: whether stickers exist here, how many, and the way in
 * to placing one.
 *
 * The reveal is site-wide and sticky rather than per image — pressing it here
 * turns stickers on everywhere until you turn them off, which is why it reads
 * from the store rather than owning state.
 *
 * Styling comes from whatever `ReactionSettingsProvider` this is mounted under,
 * the same way the reaction buttons get theirs, so the row stays consistent
 * without this component knowing anything about the surface it sits on. The hook
 * returns `{}` with no provider, so the base props below are what a surface
 * without one — a feed card, later — would get.
