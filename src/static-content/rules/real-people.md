title: "Content Rules: Real People"
---

As our community grows, we're committed to keeping it an enjoyable and respectful space for everyone. A place where we can harness the power of AI, while ensuring everyone's privacy and consent are respected. To this end, we've been refining our guidelines regarding the use of images depicting real people.

## Depicting Real People
Portraying real people in any mature or suggestive context is strictly prohibited. This includes:
1. **Clothing:** No low-cut shirts/dresses, short skirts or anything that wouldn't pass a conservative high school dress code. Think, "Would I wear this to a professional job interview?" If not, it's best to refrain.
2. **Body Parts:** Exaggerated depictions of breasts, butts, thighs, or genitalia are a no-go zone. We're all about capturing likeness, not exaggeration or objectification.
3. **Poses:** Let's keep it professional, folks! Avoid suggestive poses like looking over the shoulder, bending over, or any poses meant to accentuate body features. The same goes for facial expressions meant to infer arousal.

## FAQs

### Q: How are these guidelines enforced?
**A:** Every image uploaded is sent for AI content and moderation tagging (utilizing Amazon Rekognition), which automatically flags images potentially containing mature content. For models that have been marked as representing a real person, any image that potentially contains mature content is sent for manual human moderator review before the image will be allowed to appear on the site. Our AI detection isn't perfect, and not all images containing real people are properly tagged, so if you see something, please take a moment to report it.

### Q: How can I report content that I believe violates the community guidelines?
**A:** If you come across content that you believe doesn't adhere to our community guidelines, please don't hesitate to report it. A "Report" button is generally available in content menus on most images and models through-out the site. If you don't see it, you can always reach out to the moderators on our Discord server. We appreciate your vigilance in keeping our community safe and respectful.

### Q: Why are you so strict about this?
**A:** Good question! We believe that everyone has the right to their own likeness. Unless people have explicitly given consent to be depicted in a certain way, we don't condone it. We're all about fostering a respectful community, and we want to lay down clear expectations now, to protect all our users in the future.

### Q: I've used a person's name in my prompt, but the image doesn't resemble them. Is that okay?
**A:** Absolutely. As long as the intent wasn't to depict *that* person in a way that goes against our guidelines, you're good to go.

### Q: What if my resource is of an adult-film star, who regularly appears in more revealing clothing?
**A:** Great point, but here's the distinction. Those individuals consented to being filmed and depicted in certain ways. Here on Civitai, we want to ensure we respect everyone's consent, regardless of their profession.

### Q: My resource is meant to depict a character, like Jack Reacher, but it's trained on Tom Cruise and Alan Ritchson. So can I not do NSFW content of the character?
**A:** The key here is resemblance. If the image closely resembles either actor, it's best to keep it SFW. Let's focus on capturing the essence of the character, rather than anything more provocative.

### Q: Can I use historical figures in my AI models?
**A:** Yes, but with respect and dignity. Historical figures can be a great resource for educational purposes. However, it's important to depict them accurately and respectfully, to honor the history they represent.

### Q: What about using images of fictional characters played by real actors?
**A:** Fictional characters are generally fair game, but remember, if likeness is very obvious (Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible for example), it's important to adhere to the same guidelines we use for real people.

### Q: I am the real person or a legal representitive of the real person displayed in these images. I did not consent to the use of my likeness, can they be taken down?
**A:** We care a lot about the rights of individuals and the use of their likeness. If you find an image thats depicting your likeness you can request to have removed by filling out **[this form](https://forms.clickup.com/8459928/f/825mr-6491/4EW9JSIS4J9I1AUM6J)**, or by emailing us at digital-likeness@civitai.com

### Q: Are there any restrictions on using AI to create child-like models?
**A:** Models intended for the photo-realistic depiction of minors are prohibited. You can read more about our requirements for content depicting minors [here](/content/rules/minors)

### Q: What happens if someone repeatedly violates the community guidelines?
**A:** We take violations of our community guidelines seriously. Users who repeatedly fail to comply with our guidelines may face sanctions, such as content removal, temporary suspension, or, in extreme cases, permanent banishment from the kingdom (community). We hope it never comes to that, though!

### Q: Can I provide feedback or suggest changes to the community guidelines?
**A:** Of course! We value your input. After all, this community is like a potluck – everyone brings something to the table. If you have suggestions for improving the guidelines or have spotted something we might have missed, please let us know by <a href="/canny/feedback" target="_blank">submitting feedback</a> or reaching out to us on Discord.

Remember, these guidelines are here to make sure that Civitai remains an innovative, respectful, and constructive community. With your cooperation and input, we can continue to make this community a shining example of how AI can be harnessed responsibly and creatively.
