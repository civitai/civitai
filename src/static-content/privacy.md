The content you post to the Services will be displayed on the Services and viewable by other users by default. Although this content is public by default, below in the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Policy, we describe the controls that you can use, along with other relevant settings associated with your account, to limit the sharing of certain information. We are not responsible for the other users' use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what to post or how you identify yourself on the Services.

**Third-Party App Integrations.** If you connect a third-party application to our Services, we may disclose certain information to that third party.

We may also transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services.
