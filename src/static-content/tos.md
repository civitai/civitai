Last Updated: 01/30/2025

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Civit AI, Inc. (“Civitai,” “we,” or “us”) and our website at [www.civitai.com](https://www.civitai.com), along with our related websites, hosted applications, mobile or other downloadable applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, the “Service”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and Civitai regarding your use of the Service.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:
BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CIVITAI’S PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE “TERMS”). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND CIVITAI’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY CIVITAI AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

ARBITRATION NOTICE. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 18 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION), YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND CIVITAI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

1. **Civitai Service Overview.** Civitai is a platform designed to boost the creation and exploration of AI models and AI-generated media. We offer an environment where users of the Service (“Users”) may be able to generate images (“Generated Images”) on the Service, as well as upload, share, and discover custom machine learning models (“Models”) that have been trained on distinct datasets to generate art or media in a specific style.

2. **Eligibility.** You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.

3. **Accounts and Registration.** To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account, whether directly or through a third party integration (“Account”). When you register for an Account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, username, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account. If you believe that your Account is no longer secure, then you should immediately notify us at [support@civitai.com](mailto:support@civitai.com).

4. **Buzz.** Citivai may offer and accept on-platform points (“Buzz”). In addition to these Terms, your use of Buzz is subject to the [Buzz Terms and Conditions](https://civitai.com/content/buzz/terms), which are incorporated into these Terms by this reference.

5. **General Payment Terms.** Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars or Buzz and are non-refundable, except as required by law.

- 5.1 **Price.** Civitai reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Civitai will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page(s) periodically for current pricing information. Civitai may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Civitai gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Civitai, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Civitai’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to you.

- 5.2 **Monetization of Creator Content.** As a creator (“Creator”), you may make your User Content (defined below) available to other Users for purchase, for example, on a one-time basis or on a subscription basis. You may determine the pricing and/or subscription tiers for your offerings at your discretion. All purchase prices will be as stated. In order to satisfy our tax obligations, we may collect tax identification information and, in certain circumstances, report this information and earnings to tax authorities as legally required. If required by applicable law, Civitai will issue you a Form 1099-K at year end. For purposes of Forms 1099-K, Civitai will treat all Creator earnings as earned for the sales of goods or services. In such circumstances, you will provide us with accurate tax identification information, and we may report this information and earnings to tax authorities as legally required. You are responsible for reporting any income, withholding, or other earnings-based taxes which may be due as a result of money you’ve earned on Civitai. We may be responsible for a number of transactional taxes across the world. These include, but are not limited to, Valued Added Tax, Goods and Services Tax and other local service or sales taxes in non-US locations, as well as state sales tax in the United States. In locales where we are required to collect transaction tax. invoices presented to and payments processed from will include the tier or custom payment amount plus the applicable tax.

- 5.3 **Purchase of Creator Content.** If you purchase any offerings of Creators through the Service, you agree to pay on a one-time or subscription basis as specified by the Creators. You agree that Creators have the right to determine pricing and/or subscription tiers for their offerings and may adjust such from time to time at their discretion. You are solely responsible for ensuring that you have sufficient Buzz in your Account for your purchase(s) and agree that your purchase(s) may be denied or canceled in the event that your Account balance is insufficient. If any User Content or channels are offered on a subscription basis, they will be subject to Section 5.7 below.

- 5.4 **Refund**. As a customer, you are eligible for a refund in the following situations:
  - Recurring Technical Problems: If ongoing technical difficulties hinder your use of the platform.
  - Failure to Receive Buzz: If Buzz you've purchased isn't received or added to your account due to technical issues.
  - Flawed Resource: If digital products you've trained are substantially flawed beyond what could be reasonably attributed to user error.

  Refunds for expenditures on 3rd party services hosted via API on Civitai will only be granted if Civitai can secure a refund from the respective service provider. Please note that not all API services permit refunds, and Civitai's ability to issue a refund is contingent on this limitation.

  Civitai retains the right to refuse a refund in the following cases:
  - You were muted or removed from the platform for breaking content guidelines.
  - You are unable to achieve desired results through no technical fault of the platform.
  - You have changed your mind.

  Civitai will grant you a refund if any User Content you purchased through the Service was removed or taken down from the Service by us or by the Creator in compliance with applicable requirements under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Refunds will be given in Buzz for platform services and credited to your account upon request or within a reasonable time.

- 5.5 **Payment Processing.** Civitai may contract with a third party to process payments submitted through the Service (the “Payment Processor”). Users may be required to provide their payment method details to the Payment Processor. Before you pay for Buzz through the Payment Processor, you will have an opportunity to review the amounts that you will be charged.

- 5.6 **Authorization.** You authorize Civitai to charge all sums for the orders or purchases that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Civitai, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your Account or otherwise provided to us. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then Civitai may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.

- 5.7 **Subscription Service.** You may be able to subscribe to certain channels or subscription-based plans offered by Creators or by us through the Service, with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Subscription Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select (such period, the “Initial Subscription Period”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “Subscription Period”) unless you cancel the Subscription Service, or the Creator or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Civitai or the Payment Processor to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums (in Buzz or in another currency) on or before the payment due date. Your Account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Civitai or Payment Processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your Account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by following the instructions in your Account or contacting us at support@civitai.com. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.

- 5.8 **Delinquent Accounts.** Civitai may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal Subscription Fee is due, then Civitai reserves the right to delete your account and any information or User Content (defined below) associated with your Account without any liability to you.

  - (f) a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or other intellectual property right owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

  Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Civitai with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control as well as with the operators of publicly available databases that track notifications of claimed infringement, and you consent to Civitai making such disclosures. You should consult with your own lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.

- 12.4 **Repeat Infringers.** Civitai’s policy is to: (a) remove or disable access to material that Civitai believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (b) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Service by any User who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights. Civitai will terminate the accounts of Users that are determined by Civitai to be repeat infringers. Civitai reserves the right, however, to suspend or terminate accounts of Users in our sole discretion.

- 12.5 **Counter Notification.** If you receive a notification from Civitai that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Civitai with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to Civitai’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 12.2 (DMCA Notification), and include substantially the following information:

- 12.6 **Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.** If you submit a Counter Notification to Civitai in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then Civitai will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Civitai will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Civitai will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Civitai’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Civitai’s system or network.

- 12.7 **False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.** The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [Civitai] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Civitai reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

1.  **Modification of Terms.** We may, from time to time, change these Terms. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Revisions will be effective immediately except that, for existing Users, material revisions will be effective 30 days after posting or notice to you of the revisions unless otherwise stated.

If you do not agree to the modified Terms, then you should remove your User Content and discontinue your use of the Service. Except as expressly permitted in this Section 13 (Modification of Terms), these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties to these Terms.

2.  **Term, Termination, and Modification of the Service**

- 14.1 **Term.** These Terms are effective beginning when you accept the Terms or first download, install, access, or use the Service, and ending when terminated as described in Section 14.2 (Termination).

CIVITAI DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND CIVITAI DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.

- 16.2 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR CIVITAI ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE CIVITAI ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

17. **Limitation of Liability**

- 17.1 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE CIVITAI ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE, ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, OR ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES OR APIs ACCESSED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY CIVITAI ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

18. **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

- 18.1 **Generally.** Except as described in Section 18.2 (Exceptions) and 18.3 (Opt-Out), you and Civitai agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.
  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Civitai ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

- 18.2 **Exceptions.** Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

- 18.3 **Opt-Out.** If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Civit AI, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 447 Sutter St, Ste 405 PMB1283, San Francisco, CA 94108, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Civitai receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 19.2 (Governing Law). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

- 18.4 **Arbitrator.** This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Civitai.

- 18.5 **Commencing Arbitration.** Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Civitai’s address for Notice is: Civit AI, Inc., 447 Sutter St, Ste 405 PMB1283, San Francisco, CA 94108. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or Account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Civitai may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Civitai will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if the Company has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.

- 18.6 **Arbitration Proceedings.** Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your [residence/billing address] unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your [residence/billing address]. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Civitai must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.

- 18.7 **Arbitration Relief.** Except as provided in Section 18.8 (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Civitai before an arbitrator was selected, Civitai will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties , except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

- 18.8 **No Class Actions.** YOU AND CIVITAI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Civitai agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

- 18.9 **Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.** If Civitai makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Civitai’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your Account with Civitai will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

- 18.10 **Enforceability.** If Section 18.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if Civitai receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19.2 (Governing Law) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
