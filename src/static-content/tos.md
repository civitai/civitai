Your use of our website to do anything beyond simply accessing/viewing it (that is, uploading, downloading, commenting, etc.), constitutes not merely your consent, but also your electronic signature, meaning that you are contractually bound by these terms.

## Content
You are solely responsible for the Content you post, publish, display, or otherwise make available on our Website, and for any action or omission that results from your use of the Services (including our Content or other user's Content), or the use by a person or an entity that you have authorized under your Account.

You represent and warrant that you have ownership, control, and responsibility for the Content you post or otherwise make available on our Website, or otherwise have the right to do so. Your Content must not be misleading or unlawful, and must not violate any of these Terms, applicable law and regulation, or infringe or misappropriate any rights of any person or entity. We may remove your Content at any time, at our sole discretion, if we have concerns about your Content.

By posting your Content or otherwise making it available on our Website, you acknowledge and agree that:

- Your Content will be viewed by others, and as a result:
  - If you set your Content as public, you grant each User a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, display, publish, reproduce, distribute, and make derivative works of your Content through our Services and functionalities.
  - If you set your Content as private, we will use reasonable and appropriate measures designed to keep your Content confidential and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, we may access or share your private information pursuant to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
- When Content contains a reasonable and customary license notice (such as an open-source license), such Content should remain under the terms of that license when further accessed, distributed, or used. Neither party is permitted to remove reference to any such license.

You agree that any Content you download, access, or use from us or another User is at your own risk and subject to these Terms and/or the terms accompanying such Content.
