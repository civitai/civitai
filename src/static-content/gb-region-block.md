As of July 24, 2025 at 11:59 PM UTC, Civitai is no longer accessible to users in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

This is due to the UKâ€™s Online Safety Act (OSA), which imposes strict legal requirements on all platforms with user-generated content. These include biometric age checks, complex legal risk assessments, and personal liability for staff. These rules apply even to platforms based outside the UK.

This is not a decision we made lightly. We began looking into what compliance would involve, but quickly realized it is not something we can feasibly manage with a team of our size. The legal and financial burden is simply too great.

We are heartbroken to block access, and we know this is upsetting. If you are a UK citizen, we encourage you to contact your Member of Parliament and share your concerns about how the OSA affects access to art, technology, and online communities. You can also learn more at [Ofcomâ€™s Online Safety Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer).

We are truly sorry, and we hope to return in the future.
Thank you for being part of the Civitai community.
