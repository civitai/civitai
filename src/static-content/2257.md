Civitai is not the producer (whether primary or secondary as defined in 18 U.S.C. §2257) of any content posted on the platform. All content hosted on Civitai is generated and uploaded by third-party users, and Civitai’s role is limited to the **transmission, storage, retrieval, hosting, and formatting** of content generated using artificial intelligence models.

Please direct any request you may have regarding §2257 records in relation to any content found on Civitai, directly to the respective uploader or account holder of the content.

Civitai does **not permit** the upload of any content that contains real (non-AI) individuals, whether public or private figures. All mature or sexually suggestive content must include sufficient generation metadata, in accordance with our Terms of Service [Terms of Service](https://civitai.com/content/tos).

If you believe content on Civitai violates this policy, or if you require assistance regarding any uploaded content, or assistance contacting the content uploader, please contact our compliance team at [support@civitai.com](mailto:support@civitai.com).

Civitai abides by the following compliance standards for mature content:

- All users uploading mature or suggestive content must be over the age of eighteen (18) years of age (or age required by their State, jurisdiction or Country if more than 18 years old).
- Civitai explicitly prohibits the upload of any content that contains real people, whether identifiable or not.
- Users uploading mature content certify that:
  - The content was created using AI, not involving real individuals or photography.
  - All visible figures are entirely synthetic creations, not derived from real photos, scans, or videos.
  - Generation metadata is provided to demonstrate AI origin, including at minimum the prompt, and preferably additional parameters such as model, sampler, and seed.
- Any content that fails to meet metadata or verification requirements may be removed and may result in account action.

Civitai takes compliance seriously and will promptly respond to lawful inquiries related to suspected violations of U.S. Code §2257. Any uploader found in violation of our Terms or attempting to upload non-AI content, mature content portraying real people, or any illegal material will be permanently banned and reported as appropriate.
