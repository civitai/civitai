                  are committed to harnessing this potential responsibly. As part of this
                  commitment, we have established clear guidelines to safeguard minors, respect real

                  Our platform is dedicated to fostering creativity and innovation while upholding
                  standards of safety and respect. We understand the importance of balancing the
                  freedom to create with the need to protect vulnerable groups and individuals.
                  Therefore, we have stringent policies against the creation of photorealistic
                  images of minors, depictions of extreme or illegal conduct, and any content that
                  may be deemed disturbing or offensive. We also prohibit the use of our resources
                  to generate the likeness of specific individuals for non-consensual or commercial
                  purposes.

                  At Civitai, we utilize AI systems along with the power of community to maintain a

                  upholding our standards by accurately tagging content, reporting violations, and
                  providing feedback. Your involvement is crucial in shaping a safe AI community.

                  As a platform, our goal is to foster an environment of openness and inclusivity
                  while empowering users with tools to see content that is the most interesting and

                  <li>
                    <strong>Tag-Based Filtering:</strong> Users can hide specific content based on
                    tags. For instance, if a user {`doesn't`} want to view anime content, they can
                    hide the anime tag.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Selective Hiding:</strong> Users can choose to hide specific images,

                    moderated content they wish to view, such as enabling nudity, but not explicit
                    nudity. Furthermore, moderated content remains hidden until a user registers an
                    account and sets their personal content visibility preferences.

                    labels applied to images, helping us refine our image classification system. We

                    trigger a manual review before the content becomes publicly visible.
