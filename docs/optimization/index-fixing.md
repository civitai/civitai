Okay, so I want you to look at all of the tables in the database, targeting first the ones that are the biggest, and look at the indexes on them, and the things that they're kind of designed for. So for example, if it was post, and you saw an index for model version, then go and look in the code base and see how that connection gets used. You can look for queries in SQL or Prisma. And then, depending on how that's used, so in this case, model version uses post ID to get all the images in a post. If the index doesn't include the ID of that row, which would make this a heapless transaction, a heapless search, then capture that index and note the index name. Basically recreate the index. suggest the recreation of that index to include the properties that would be necessary to make those connections more easily without having to hit the heap. And look for many places where we can essentially expand the coverage of our indexes to make it so that queries don't have to hit disk.
