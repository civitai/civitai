// DEVICE-LEVEL account linking (docs/main-app-auth-cutover.md, section E). A browser is identified by an
// httpOnly `device` cookie; the hub keeps a per-device set of accounts that have authenticated on it, each
// with a `lastSwitchedAt`. Account-switch is authorized against THIS set (+ an active session) — never a
// client-held credential and never a User-to-User DB link, so there's no cross-device association and XSS
// can't read the device id. Accounts idle for >30d are pruned → a switch into them requires a fresh login.
//
// LAZY MATERIALIZATION (capacity): the set is ONLY written once a browser actually has ≥2 distinct linked
// accounts — the only case where the switcher is useful. A plain single-account login writes NOTHING (it would
// otherwise leave a per-browser hash for the ~84% of users who never switch, which had grown the
// `device:accounts:*` keyspace into the bulk of sysRedis). The "2nd account" signal is a session mint for
// userId X on a request whose existing valid session (the incoming civ-token cookie) belongs to a DIFFERENT
// userId Y → linkAccount materializes BOTH X and Y at that moment. touchAccount only REFRESHES an existing set.

// login/switch/refresh while ≥2 accounts are linked; a browser idle 30 days forgets its account set and a
// switch-into requires a fresh login. The keyspace is bounded by LAZY MATERIALIZATION above (only ~0.01% of
// browsers are ever multi-account → ~1k keys steady-state), NOT by this TTL — so it's purely the shared-device
// "seamless switch-back" / re-auth window (a security/UX knob), not a capacity lever.
