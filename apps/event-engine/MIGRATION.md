# metric-event-watcher → event-engine (monorepo migration)

This directory is the **`metric-event-watcher`** service relocated into the civitai monorepo as
`apps/event-engine` (**renamed** — see below), at its **clean committed HEAD** — none of the in-progress
outbox / delete-side-effects work (the `feat/image-delete-side-effects` branch) is included.

- **Worktree/branch:** `feat/metric-event-watcher-monorepo` (branched off `main`).
- **Source:** `metric-event-watcher` @ HEAD via `git archive` (so no uncommitted local changes came across).
- **event-engine-common:** vendored under `src/common/` at its clean submodule HEAD (`49b0d4f`) — no longer a
  git submodule here. **Not** yet extracted into a shared package (deferred — see below); the standalone
  `event-engine-common` submodule/repo will be examined separately.

## Renamed to `event-engine`
The app now reflects its broader scope (metrics + signals + CDC side effects), not just metrics. **Only the
packaging/deploy-facing name was changed** — dir `apps/event-engine`, package `@civitai/event-engine`, and the
Dockerfile filter/paths. **Runtime identifiers were intentionally left unchanged for continuity:**
- Kafka **consumer group** default `metric-event-watcher` (`src/config/index.ts`, `scripts/reset-consumer-offsets.ts`)
  — so the cutover resumes from existing offsets rather than reprocessing.
- Prometheus **`app` label `metric-event-watcher`** + the **`mew_` metric prefix** (`src/metrics.ts`) — so existing
  dashboards/alerts keep working. (The legacy `k8s/grafana-dashboard.json` still keys on these.)
- Kafka `clientId` (`src/index.ts`) — cosmetic; left as-is.

Rename these later as a deliberate, separately-planned step (with an offset seed + dashboard update) if desired.

## Approach: lift-and-shift (deliberately minimal)

The goal was a faithful move, not a rewrite. So the app is **self-contained**: its own dependencies, its own
`tsc && tsc-alias` (CommonJS) build, its own `tsconfig.json` (`@/*` path aliases), and EEC vendored in-tree.
It drops into `apps/*` as a pnpm workspace and is auto-discovered — no `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `turbo.json` /
root changes were needed.

### What changed vs. the standalone repo
- `package.json`: name → `@civitai/event-engine`, `"private": true`; dropped repo-level scripts
  (`sync:submodule`, `install:hooks`, `release*`). Deps/build/tsconfig kept as-is.
- Removed `.gitmodules` (submodule retired → vendored) and `package-lock.json` (npm → the monorepo is pnpm).
- `Dockerfile` rewritten to the monorepo pnpm-deploy pattern (see below) — **DRAFT, unverified**.
- `k8s/`, `.github/`, `docker-compose.yml` are kept **as legacy reference only** (the old CI + the Kafka/
  Debezium infra manifests). They are inert here and should be relocated to the ops repo — see DevOps below.

## Outbox reconciliation poller (ported in on top of the lift-and-shift)
A background **OutboxPoller** was ported in — a backstop that drains Outbox rows the live CDC path never
processed (created pre-connector, during downtime, or CDC misses), with retry/park/re-drive. Files:
`src/services/outbox-poller.ts`, wiring in `src/services/event-processor.ts` (`processOutboxRecord` +
start/stop), `OUTBOX_POLL_*`/`OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS` config, `outboxPollerMetrics` (`mew_outbox_*`), and
`scripts/redrive-outbox.ts` (`pnpm redrive:outbox`).
- **Single-active across autoscaled pods** via a Postgres *two-int* advisory lock
  (`pg_try_advisory_lock(25974, 1)`) — a separate key space from the main app's single-bigint
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(articleId)`, so it can never collide. Self-healing on pod death; `FOR UPDATE SKIP
  LOCKED` + cursor paging are additional safety.
- **DEFAULT OFF.** It requires an `attempts` int column on `"Outbox"`, added by
  `packages/civitai-db-schema/prisma/migrations/20260720120000_add_outbox_table/` — which also **models the
  pre-existing Outbox table + `OutboxEntity` enum** in `schema.full.prisma` (they existed in the DB but were
  not in the Prisma schema). **Sequence: apply that migration → run `pnpm db:generate` to regenerate the
  derived types (`models.ts`, `kysely/*` — NOT hand-edited here) → set `OUTBOX_POLL_ENABLED=true`.** Until the
  column exists, leave the poller off (its SQL would error each sweep).

## Security
`.env.example` shipped real-looking production credentials in the source repo; they were **scrubbed to
placeholders** here. The underlying Postgres/ClickHouse/Redis credentials were committed upstream — **rotate
them** as an ops follow-up.

## Required before it builds
Run **`pnpm install` at the repo root** once, so `pnpm-lock.yaml` includes this new app. Until then the
Docker `--frozen-lockfile` install and any `pnpm --filter` build will fail. After that,
`pnpm --filter @civitai/event-engine typecheck && ... build` should pass (it builds clean as a
standalone repo today).

## Deferred follow-ups (not done here)
These are intentionally out of scope for the lift-and-shift; they turn it monorepo-*native* and are the
workstreams from `docs/plans/monorepo-migration.md` (in the watcher repo):

1. **Root lockfile** — `pnpm install` to register the app (prerequisite for everything below).
2. **Adopt `@civitai/*` packages** — replace this app's own Redis/ClickHouse/Axiom clients + env with
   `@civitai/redis`, `@civitai/clickhouse`, `@civitai/axiom` (recommend keeping raw `pg` rather than
   `@civitai/db`). Currently it ships its own clients.
3. **Convert build to tsup/ESM** — the siblings (`apps/orchestrator-gateway`, `apps/notifications`) bundle
   with tsup and run ESM. This app is still `tsc`/CJS. Convert when adopting `@civitai/*`.
4. **Retire the submodule properly** — fold `event-engine-common` into a shared `packages/*` workspace
   consumed by BOTH this app and the monolith, then delete the vendored `src/common` here and the monolith's
   root `event-engine-common` submodule. Note the two EEC copies are at **different commits** today
   (this app `49b0d4f`; the monolith submodule `7a0c4b0`) — reconcile before sharing.
5. **ClickHouse version** — `@clickhouse/client` is `1.12` here vs `0.2.2` at the monorepo root; only needs
   reconciling if adopting `@civitai/clickhouse`.
6. **Meilisearch** — keep this app's own client, or factor a `@civitai/meilisearch` package.
7. **DevOps (Zach):** add a Tekton tag-webhook trigger + a `release-app.mjs`/`release:event-engine`
   entry + the k8s Deployment/HPA/secret (port from the legacy `k8s/09-metric-watcher-app.yml`). The
   **Kafka/Debezium k8s infra (`k8s/02-*`, `03-*`) stays as separate infra** regardless. Deploy the app on
   the same Kafka **consumer group** so the cutover doesn't reprocess or drop offsets.
8. **Node 20 → 22** — the monorepo standard is Node 22; bump `@types/node` and validate when convenient.
9. **Optional rename** — if this becomes the general events/signals/CDC app, rename the package/dir.
